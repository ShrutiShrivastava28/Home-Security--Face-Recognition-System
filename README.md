HOME SECURITY- Face Recognition System (Prototype Model)

Overview

The Face recognition system is a project aimed at developing an intelligent software application that can identify and authenticate based on their facial features. the system utilizes advanced computer vision technologies and machine learning algorithms to analyze and matches face against the database of known individuals. By leveraging the power of aftificial intelligence, the project aims to provide a robust and efficient solutions for various application, inculding access control, surveillance, law enforcement, and personal identifications.

project goal is to overcome the limitations of traditional identification methods, such as passwords, PINs, and physical tokens, which can be easily compromised or misplaced. Facial recognition offers a non-intrusive and convenient means of identification, as it relies on unique facial characteristics that are difficult to forge or replicate. 

Installations 

Requirements:-
1) Pycharm
2) mongodb 
3) Libraries like sklearn, pandas, numpy, CV2
4) Openface
5) Haar Cascade 

In this there are 5 modules named as training.py, recognize.py, retriveimage.py, sound.py and main.py, main.py is a python module that is linked with all other modules and hence provide the interface through which we can get access.

This system uses artificial intelligence to scan and identify the faces Of the visitors comes, near the gate, the system can scans the face and compare with the existing facial structure that is stored in the database. it uses haar cascade algorithm for Face Detection and openface for Face recognition
